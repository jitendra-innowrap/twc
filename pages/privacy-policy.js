                                        <p>We may store information such as survey responses and contact information, that are necessary to enable us to operate effectively and deliver our services to you. We may also transfer your Personal Information to a third party as a result of a merger, acquisition, reorganization or similar transaction; when required by law or to respond to legal process; to protect our customers; to protect lives; to maintain the security of the Services; and to protect the rights or property of Company. In such event, and to the extent legally permitted, we will notify you and, if there are material changes in relation to the processing of your Personal Information, give you an opportunity to consent to such changes.</p>

                                        <h4>Protection of Company and Others</h4>
                                        <p>We will also share Personal Information with companies, organizations, or individuals outside of Company if we have a good-faith belief that access, use, preservation, or disclosure of your Personal Information is reasonably necessary to detect or protect against fraud or security issues, enforce our terms of use, meet any enforceable government request, defend against legal claims, or protect against harm to our legal rights or safety.</p>

                                        <h4>How Do We Use Tracking Technologies?</h4>
                                        <p>A "cookie" is a small file placed on your hard drive by some of our web pages. We, or third parties we do business with, may use cookies to help us analyze our web page flow, customize our services, content and advertising, measure promotional effectiveness, and promote trust and safety. Cookies are commonly used at most major transactional websites in much the same way we use them in our Services.</p>

                                        <p>You may delete and block all cookies from our Services, but parts of the Services may not work. We want to be open about our cookie use.</p>

                                        <p>Even if you are only browsing the Services, certain information (including computer and connection information, browser type and version, operating system and platform details, and the time of accessing the Services) is automatically collected about you. This information will be collected every time you access the Services and it will be used for the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy.</p>

                                        <p>You can reduce the information cookies collect from your device. An easy way of doing this is often to change the settings in your browser. If you do that you should know that (a) your use of the Services may be adversely affected (and possibly entirely prevented), (b) your experience of this and other sites that use cookies to enhance or personalize your experience may be adversely affected, and (c) you may not be presented with advertising that reflects the way that you use our and other sites. You find out how to make these changes to your browser at this site: <a href="www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/" target="_blank">www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/</a>. Unless you have adjusted your browser settings so that it will refuse cookies, our system will send cookies as soon as access our Services. By using the Services you consent to this, unless you change your browser settings.</p>

                                        <h4>How Do We Secure Your Personal Information?</h4>
                                        <p>We take reasonable steps to protect your Personal Information against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, misuse, or destruction. Unfortunately, no data transmission or storage system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. The safety and security of your Personal Information also depends on you. If you have an account with us, you are responsible for keeping your membership details confidential. Your account is protected by your account password and we urge you to take steps to keep your Personal Information safe by not disclosing your password and by logging out of your account after each use. We further protect your Personal Information from potential security breaches by implementing certain technological security measures including encryption, firewalls and secure socket layer technology. However, these measures do not guarantee that your Personal Information will not be accessed, disclosed, altered or destroyed by breach of such firewalls and secure server software. By using the Services, you acknowledge that you understand and agree to assume these risks.</p>
                                        <p>We retain your personal data while your account is in existence or as needed to provide you Services. This includes data you or others provided to us and data generated or inferred from your use of the Services</p>
                                        <p>Your Choices Regarding Information</p>

                                        </p>

                                        <h4>Changing or Deleting Your Personal Data</h4>
                                        <p>All users may review, update, correct, or delete the Personal Information provided in their user account (including any imported contacts) by contacting us at <a href="mailto:inquiries@thepartycafe.com">inquiries@thepartycafe.com</a> or by accessing their user account. For your protection, we may only share and update the Personal Information associated with the specific email address used to send us the request, and we may need to verify your identity before doing so. We will try to comply with such requests in a reasonably timely manner. If you completely and permanently delete all of your Personal Information, your user account may become deactivated. If you wish to cancel your account, you may do so through your account page. Any personally identifiable information associated with your account will be deleted as soon as is reasonably practical or as required by applicable law. Please note that we may retain information that is otherwise deleted in anonymized and aggregated form, in archived or backup copies as required pursuant to records retention obligations, or otherwise as required by law.</p>
                                        <p>We may retain an archived copy of your records as required by law or for legitimate business purposes.</p>

                                        <h4>Opting Out of Email Communications</h4>
                                        <p>We may use some of the information we collect for marketing purposes, including to send you promotional communications about new Company features, products, events, or other opportunities. If you wish to stop receiving these communications or to opt out of the use of your information for these purposes, please follow the opt-out instructions, such as clicking "Unsubscribe" (or similar opt-out language) in those communications. You can also contact us at <a href="mailto:support@thepartycafe.com">support@thepartycafe.com</a> to opt out. Despite your indicated email preferences, we may still send you service-related communications, including notices of any updates to our terms of service or privacy policy.</p>

                                        <h4>Links to Third Party Websites</h4>
                                        <p>We may provide links to other websites. We have no control over these websites, and they are subject to their own terms of use and privacy policies. As such, we do not endorse and are not responsible for the availability of, or for any content, advertising, products, or other materials on or available from, these third-party websites.</p>
                                        <p>By using the Services, you agree that we will not be liable for any damage or loss caused by your use of or reliance on any content, advertising, products, or other materials on or available from these third-party websites.</p>

                                        <h4>How We Respond to Do Not Track Signals</h4>
                                        <p>Your browser settings may allow you to automatically transmit a "Do Not Track" signal to websites and other online services you visit. We do not alter our practices when we receive a "Do Not Track" signal from a visitor’s browser because we do not track our visitors to provide targeted advertising.</p>

                                        <h4>Children Under 16</h4>
                                        <p>The Services are not directed to individuals who are under the age of sixteen (16), and we do not solicit or knowingly collect Personal Information from children under the age of sixteen (16).
